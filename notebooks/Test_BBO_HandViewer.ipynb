    "# A Simulation Tutorial for Better Decisionmaking at Bridge\n",
    "\n",
    "This article describes how computers can be used to help with the analysis of decisions made at the game of bridge. Probably many readers will be familiar with the fact that Monte Carlo simulation is a technique widely used by good quality bridge playing software, and even some top-class human players do something similar in their head at the table. What I would like to show is that such kind of analysis is not too hard to do, and should be accessible to \"mere-mortals\" who are neither bridge professionals nor PhDs in artificial intelligence. The concepts will be introduced by example, and are all related to a deal that I recently played and found interesting. We shall look at decisions that arise in bidding, cardplay and at the opening lead.\n",

    "The optimists will no doubt like the nice fit with four aces and bid 6&clubs;. Others, more cautious, will note that partner's first-hand non-vulnerable preempt could be quite wild with just QJ to six in clubs and not much else; so they might be tempted to make do with a game and bid 5&clubs;. Another conservative oldfashioned bidder might argue that partner promises six tricks for his preempt and we can count ten sure tricks, therefore 3NT is laydown and 5&clubs; might go down on occasion, so why not bid the safest game of 3NT?\n",
    "\n",
    "I think that none of the above options are wrong, but some bids are certainly more likely to score better than others. Our approach to selecting the best bid is by simulation. We shall sample a large number of random deals such that South holds the cards shown and North's hand is consistent with his 3&clubs; opening. Then we'll do double dummy analysis on every sampled deal and compare the outcomes of the contracts we are considering.\n",

    "In this particular case we are deciding between the following bids: PASS, 3NT, 5&clubs;, 6&clubs; and 6NT, each of which sets the final contract.

If we are to make this slam, then something has to happen in the hearts. The hope is that after losing the heart jack to the queen we can establish a heart, either by ruffing the third round and dropping the ten, or by doing a ruffing finesse against the ten in West. I invite you to step through the first few tricks by pressing the \"Next \" button at the bottom of the diagram. We take the lead (West follows small), we draw trumps in two runds with the K and Q (West discards a diamond on the second), and we lose the heart jack to East's queen (West following small). Having won the &hearts;Q, East exits with a diamond to dummy's ace (East follows suit).\n",

The main part is the for-loop which samples random hands for E-W and counts how many times the ruffing finesse line works and how many times the ruff-the-ten-out line works."
